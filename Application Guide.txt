Project Plan: Cross-Border Remittance App – White-Label Generation & Embedded Integration
Introduction
Cross-border remittance applications enable users to send money internationally with features like user onboarding (KYC), transaction processing, history tracking, and support. The current mobile application is built natively for Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift). To expand its reach through partners, we propose two complementary strategies:
White-Label Mobile App Generator – allowing rapid creation of fully branded remittance apps for partners.
Embedded Remittance Module – enabling partners to integrate remittance functionality into their existing apps via an SDK or WebView.
This document presents a comprehensive plan covering detailed use cases, system architecture, module design, toolchain and CI/CD pipeline recommendations, security/compliance measures, and a comparative analysis of the approaches (white-label vs. SDK/WebView). We also include a timeline and key dependencies for implementation.
Use Case 1: White-Label Mobile App Generator
Description and Requirements
Use Case: A business partner (e.g., a financial institution or fintech) wants to offer remittance services under their own brand. The system should generate a new iOS and Android app based on the core remittance application, but customized with the partner’s branding (logo, name, color theme). End-users downloading the partner’s app will experience the full remittance feature set as if it were built from scratch for that partner. Key Requirements:
Brand Customization: Allow injection of partner-specific branding elements (app name, icons/logos, color palette) without altering core logic.
Full Remittance Functionality: The generated app must include all existing features – user onboarding and electronic KYC verification, secure login/authentication, sending and receiving remittances, transaction history, notifications, and in-app customer support.
Automated Build Output: The system should output platform-specific binaries for distribution – an Android APK (or AAB for Play Store) and an iOS IPA. The build process should be highly automated and reproducible.
Scalability: It should be feasible to generate and maintain dozens of such white-label apps. A single codebase should support multiple white-label variants to avoid duplicate development effort

. The backend services (database and APIs) will be shared among all variants (multi-tenant architecture)
stackoverflow.com
, with appropriate segregation of partner data.
Version Control Strategy: Avoid one-off forked code for each partner. Instead, maintain a central repository for the core app and a mechanism to apply partner-specific configurations. This ensures that updates to core features or security patches can propagate to all white-label apps with minimal effort.
Detailed Use Case Flow:
Partner Onboarding: A new partner signs an agreement to use the remittance platform. They provide branding assets (logo files, app name, brand colors, etc.) and any configuration specific to their needs (e.g., default currency or language).
App Generation Request: Through an admin interface or script, the partner’s details are registered. The system associates the partner with a unique app ID (for bundle identifiers/package names) and stores their branding assets in a configuration module.
Automated Build: The CI/CD pipeline is triggered for this partner. It takes the core mobile app codebase and merges it with the partner’s branding configuration to produce a custom build
blog.theodo.com
. This involves:
Replacing app name, icons, and splash screens with the partner’s versions.
Applying the partner’s color theme and styling constants.
Configuring any partner-specific keys or URLs (for example, if the app uses third-party services like maps or analytics, use the partner’s credentials if needed).
Compiling the Android app (with a unique application ID) and the iOS app (with a unique bundle identifier and app provisioning profile).
Delivery & Deployment: The pipeline produces the APK/AAB and IPA files. These are either delivered to the partner or automatically submitted to the app stores. For instance, Fastlane can automate App Store and Play Store submissions for each white-label app, including managing code signing for multiple apps in one workflow
docs.fastlane.tools
. Partners may publish the apps under their own developer accounts, or the company can publish on their behalf – this needs to be decided per partnership.
User Experience: End-users download the partner’s branded app from the store. When launched, it behaves identical to the core app (same backend connectivity and features), but with the partner’s branding. Users register or log in, complete KYC within the app, and perform remittances normally. The branding difference is mainly cosmetic; functionally all partners share the core platform.
Maintenance & Updates: When a new version of the core app is developed (e.g., new features or security updates), the system should rebuild and update all active white-label apps. Automated workflows can sequentially trigger builds for each brand or use parallel jobs. (For example, Bitrise and Codemagic CI allow triggering multiple builds with different environment variables for each app variant
blog.theodo.com
github.com
.) This ensures partners stay up-to-date. Without automation, updating, say, 100 white-label apps would require 100 separate iOS submissions and 100 Android submissions – a process that is infeasible to do manually
stackoverflow.com
. Thus, robust CI/CD is essential.
Technical Design and Architecture
The white-label solution is architected to maximize reuse of the existing code while isolating brand-specific elements. The key components and module boundaries are:
Core Application Module: Contains all shared business logic, UI screens, and features common to every app. This includes the remittance transaction workflows, KYC identity verification flows, data models, network/API client code, and general UI components. The core is brand-agnostic and defines extension points or theming capabilities to accommodate different brands. For example, UI components use a theming system where colors and logos are loaded from configuration at runtime or build time
blog.theodo.com
blog.theodo.com
.
Brand Configuration Modules: For each partner app, there is a small configuration set that overrides or extends the core where necessary. This can include:
A branding config file (e.g. JSON or XML) or constants class specifying theme colors, app display name, etc.
Image assets for the logo, launcher icon, and any brand-specific graphics.
App identifiers and store metadata (bundle ID, application ID, app store listing info unique to the partner).
These configurations “plug in” to the core app at build time. On Android, product flavor dimensions or build variants can be used to encapsulate each partner’s resources and config. On iOS, separate build targets or schemes are defined for each brand, each with its own Info.plist and asset catalog for icons/images. Thus, the architecture consists of one whitelabeled source app and multiple configuration sets for each brand, combined during the build process
blog.theodo.com
.
Figure: Example of a white-label app architecture. A single core codebase (shared logic, components, and features) is combined with separate partner-specific configuration modules (branding assets and settings) to generate multiple branded apps
blog.theodo.com
. A robust build system merges the core app with each configuration during CI/CD to produce the white-labeled outputs.
Backend Multi-Tenancy: The server side recognizes which partner app is making requests (for example, via an API key or app identifier included in requests). However, all partner apps share the same backend code and database for core functionality
stackoverflow.com
. Access controls ensure that users from one white-label app cannot see data from another. The backend may maintain a mapping of users to partner organizations for reporting and compliance, but fundamentally it’s one platform servicing multiple branded front-ends.
CI/CD Pipeline: An automated pipeline is critical for efficiency. We will set up CI workflows to handle:
Parameterized Builds: Scripts or CI jobs that accept a parameter (partner ID or config set) then check out the code, apply the branding config for that partner, and build the Android and iOS apps. Bitrise provides workflow chaining and environment variable injection to build multiple white-label versions easily
blog.theodo.com
. Similarly, Codemagic’s YAML configuration supports triggering builds for different flavors using its API
github.com
.
Code Signing and Provisioning: Each iOS build needs the appropriate provisioning profile (tied to the app’s bundle ID) and certificate. We will use Fastlane Match or a similar approach to manage code signing for dozens of apps efficiently. Fastlane Match can reuse the same iOS signing certificates for multiple apps and automatically create separate provisioning profiles per app ID
docs.fastlane.tools
. Android signing keys can be unique per app or derived from a master key; keystore files will be stored securely in the CI environment. All secrets (certificates, keystores, passwords) are managed via secure storage in CI.
Automated Testing: The pipeline should also run tests for each build. We will maintain a suite of automated regression tests (unit tests and UI tests) that run against the core logic to ensure that a new build for any partner is stable. If possible, smoke tests per brand (like launching the app and verifying the correct branding applied) will be included.
Deployment: After building, the pipeline can auto-distribute to the app stores or internal channels. For example, using Fastlane deliver and supply to upload binaries to Apple App Store Connect and Google Play Console respectively. Each partner app will have its own app listing; the CI can be configured with the appropriate API credentials for each store account. The pipeline should handle version numbers and changelogs (ensuring each partner app gets correct versioning and release notes). Partners will be involved in the app review process if the app is under their account.
Version Control and Branching: We will keep a single source repository for the mobile app with all core code and directories for partner-specific assets/config. We avoid long-lived separate branches for each partner; instead, use one main development branch. Partner customizations are managed via configuration files or build scripts rather than divergent code. (Optionally, a separate repository could store partner config files if we want to allow partner-specific access, but the build pipeline will pull from both core repo and config repo.) This strategy ensures new features or fixes in the core immediately apply to all variants. If a particular partner requires a bespoke feature, we will implement it behind a configuration flag or toggle in the core code rather than splicing the codebase.
Toolchain Selection for Automation
To achieve the above, we will leverage modern mobile DevOps tools:
Fastlane: Used to script repetitive tasks like builds and store uploads. We can create Fastlane lanes for building all white-label apps in one go, or one lane per app, and even chain lanes. Fastlane will also manage signing (via match) and interface with App Store Connect/Google Play APIs for us
docs.fastlane.tools
.
CI Services: We recommend using a cloud-based CI/CD service that supports mobile builds. Bitrise, for example, has documented patterns for white-label apps and can chain workflows for different app flavors
blog.theodo.com
. Codemagic is another suitable choice, offering API-triggered builds and automatic code signing handling. These services provide macOS build agents for iOS and Linux for Android, simplifying the process. They also allow storing secrets (signing keys, API tokens) securely.
Artifact Management: Ensure that each build’s outputs are stored. For internal testing, we might integrate Firebase App Distribution or TestFlight for distributing test builds to the team or partner. On CI, we’ll configure steps to upload the IPA/APK to these services or to an S3 bucket as needed.
Monitoring CI: With potentially many app variants, we will set up monitoring and alerting for the CI pipeline. If a nightly build of all apps is configured, any failure should trigger notifications so we can address issues (like a broken build for one partner) promptly.
Analytics & Crash Reporting: Each white-label app will include the same crash reporting SDK (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics). We can use a single Crashlytics project with multiple app identifiers, so crashes are segmented by app. This helps in maintaining quality across all variants. For the SDK integration (use case 2), we may include in the SDK an internal error logging that reports back to our server for any critical failures.
Use Case 2: Embedded Remittance Features in Partner Apps
Description and Requirements
Not all partners will want a separate app. Some have existing mobile applications and prefer to embed the remittance functionality within their own app to keep users in one place. In this use case, the system provides a modular way to integrate key remittance features – onboarding/KYC, money transfer, transaction history, and support – into a partner’s native app. We consider two integration methods:
Native SDK: A Software Development Kit (library) for Android and iOS that partners can include in their apps. The SDK provides pre-built UI screens and API clients for the remittance flows.
WebView Module: A web-based mini-application that can be loaded inside the partner’s app (via an in-app WebView), delivering the remittance functionality through responsive web pages that mimic native behavior.
In both cases, end-users will access remittance services from within the partner’s app. For example, a bank’s mobile app could have an "International Transfer" section that either invokes our SDK’s screens or loads a secure WebView pointing to our web app. The user then goes through KYC and transfer flows, and upon completion, returns to the bank app’s normal interface. The solution must include:
Full Feature Parity: The embedded module (SDK or web) should provide the same capabilities as the standalone app – new user onboarding with KYC, transaction creation, viewing past transfers, and contacting support – all within the host app.
Ease of Integration: Partners should be able to integrate with minimal effort. The SDK should have a clean API and documentation. The WebView approach should require only minimal code (loading a URL). Both approaches need a mechanism for the partner app to securely hand over user context (e.g., authentication token) to the remittance module.
Security & Isolation: The embedded component must not compromise the host app’s security or the user’s data. For instance, the SDK should operate within a sandboxed context (not exposing sensitive data to the host app unless necessary), and the WebView content should be loaded over HTTPS and restricted to our domains.
We now detail the two approaches and weigh their pros and cons.
SDK Integration Approach
In the SDK approach, we provide native libraries for both Android and iOS that encapsulate the remittance features:
Android SDK: Delivered as an AAR (Android library) via Maven or direct download. It includes Activities/Fragments for each major screen (Registration & KYC, Send Money form, Transaction List, Support Contact), plus the underlying networking code to call our APIs. The partner app adds the SDK as a dependency. Integration steps would include initializing the SDK (e.g., RemittanceSdk.init(context, apiKey, partnerId)), and then launching the provided UI components. For example, the partner could start an activity from the SDK: startActivity(RemittanceSdk.getLaunchIntent(context)) which opens the remittance flow.
iOS SDK: Delivered as a CocoaPod or Swift Package. It includes UIViewControllers for the remittance screens and API client code. The partner app might initialize with RemittanceSDK.configure(apiKey:..., partnerId:...), then present a view controller from the SDK (e.g., let vc = RemittanceSDK.shared.makeRemittanceViewController(); navigationController.pushViewController(vc, ...)).
Features: The SDK will handle all UI and logic for user onboarding (including capturing ID documents via camera, if required), KYC checks (possibly integrating with an external verification service within the SDK), creating transfers (with forms for recipient details, amount, etc.), viewing transaction history, and raising support tickets or chat. Essentially, once the SDK is invoked, it guides the user through all necessary steps and communicates with our backend.
Theming and Configuration: To ensure the SDK screens don’t feel out of place, we will allow some theming. For example, the partner could provide a primary color or logo to the SDK (so the header of screens can use the partner’s brand color). We will use neutral default styles that match common iOS/Android design conventions so that it blends reasonably well with any app. We’ll also consider localization – the SDK can use the device’s locale or allow the partner app to set the language, to match the host app’s language.
Integration Effort: The partner’s developers need to perform the following: add the SDK to their project, call initialization (likely in application startup), and invoke the SDK’s UI at the appropriate point (like on a button tap). They also should implement delegate/callback methods provided by the SDK – for example, a callback when the flow finishes (so the host app knows when to refresh certain data or update UI). In summary, the integration is fairly straightforward; the SDK is almost a plug-and-play module that handles the heavy lifting internally.
Maintenance: We will version the SDK and provide updates. Partners would need to update the SDK in their app and push a new release to get enhancements or critical fixes. We will maintain backward compatibility as much as possible to reduce the urgency of updates. A clear changelog and migration guide will accompany each SDK release.
Benefits of SDK Approach: This approach provides a native user experience integrated into the partner’s app. There is no dependency on loading web content once the app is installed, making it faster and more consistent with the rest of the app’s look and feel
mobikul.com
. The SDK can leverage device capabilities seamlessly (camera, biometrics, etc.) and can work offline for certain cached data. From a security standpoint, sensitive operations and data handling occur within the native code, which can be more secure (assuming the device is not compromised) than exposing data to a web context. Also, partners have more control – they can decide when to initialize or how to navigate to the remittance screens, possibly even do pre- or post-processing (for example, logging events to their analytics). Drawbacks of SDK Approach: It requires separate SDK implementations for Android and iOS, increasing initial development effort. Also, each partner must do a technical integration. Not all partner development teams have the same level of expertise, so we will need to provide support and perhaps example apps. Upgrades are not instant – if we fix a critical bug, we must notify all partners to update the SDK in their next app release, which might be slow if partners are on infrequent release cycles. There’s also potential for compatibility issues; for example, the SDK might conflict with a partner app’s dependencies or require a minimum OS version that the app doesn’t support. Careful versioning and modular design (to avoid dependency clashes) is needed.
WebView Integration Approach
In the WebView approach, the partner does not use a native library for the remittance features. Instead, the partner’s app will load a secure web page (or a set of pages) that we host, which provides the full remittance UI and logic. Essentially, the remittance module runs as a web application within an in-app browser frame.
Integration Mechanism: The partner app likely will have a button or menu item that opens a WebView pointed to a specific URL, for example: https://remittance.example.com/app?partnerId=XYZ&userToken=abc123. Our system would render the appropriate branded web UI (we can even use the partner’s branding on the web screens for consistency). The WebView would display screens for login/registration (or skip if SSO is implemented), KYC upload (using HTML file input for camera access), and all transaction pages.
Features and UI: We will develop a web-based frontend that mirrors the native app’s functionality. Modern web frameworks (like React or Angular) can be used to create a mobile-responsive web app. In a WebView context, we can still access device features to some extent (for instance, with appropriate configuration, the WebView can allow the user to upload a file or photo, triggering the camera). We can also implement a messaging bridge: for example, using JavaScript interfaces (on Android) or WKScriptMessageHandler (on iOS) to allow the web content to interact with the native layer if needed (e.g., to use a native feature or simply to notify when to close the WebView).
Partner App Changes: The changes required in the partner app are minimal. They need to add a WebView component or use an existing in-app browser utility. They should ensure the WebView is secured – for example, disable file access, limit it to only allow our domain (to prevent browsing arbitrary sites), and enforce TLS. The partner app will open the web module and likely show a loading indicator. After the user completes the remittance flow on the web, the module could redirect to a special URL that the partner app’s WebView code listens for (e.g., myapp://remittanceDone). When detected, the app closes the WebView and possibly shows a confirmation to the user or refreshes their balance.
Maintenance: Most of the maintenance is on our side – the web app can be updated continuously. Partners do not need to update their app whenever a change is made, as long as the interface (how they invoke the WebView) remains the same. This decouples partner release cycles from our updates.
Benefits of WebView Approach: This approach is extremely easy for partners to implement, often requiring just a URL or a small WebView component to be added
mobikul.com
. It’s cross-platform by nature – the same web app works on Android and iOS, and even future platforms. Updates to the remittance module are instant and under our control; we can fix issues or add features server-side. It also reduces the risk of integration bugs, since the partner isn’t compiling our code into their app – the interface is simply a web endpoint. For partners with limited development resources, this is an attractive option. Drawbacks of WebView Approach: The user experience may not feel as seamless or snappy as a native one. A WebView might be slightly slower and the UI might not perfectly match the native components of the host app. There is also a dependency on network connectivity for the entire feature – if the user is offline, the web module won’t load at all (whereas a native SDK could potentially allow viewing cached data like past transactions offline). From a security perspective, embedding web content can introduce certain risks: we must ensure the WebView only communicates with our trusted domain (to mitigate man-in-the-middle or loading of malicious content) and enforce SSL/TLS strictly
cheatsheetseries.owasp.org
. We also rely on the security of the WebView environment – for instance, on Android, an outdated WebView engine could have known vulnerabilities. Another consideration is mobile platform guidelines: both Apple and Google discourage apps that are basically thin wrappers around web content. In our case, it’s just one portion of the app, which is usually acceptable, but we should ensure the integration meets all App Store policies. There may be features harder to implement via WebView. For example, accessing the camera for KYC might require the user to grant the web page permission through the WebView. This is doable but can be clunkier than native. Push notifications for transaction updates would also have to route through the partner app (e.g., our backend tells the partner’s app to notify the user) since a web app won’t have its own push channel in this context.
Pros and Cons: SDK vs. WebView
To summarize the trade-offs between providing an SDK versus a WebView integration, we highlight the pros and cons of each: SDK Integration – Pros:
Native look and feel, with smooth performance and UI consistency with the rest of the app
mobikul.com
.
Full access to device capabilities (camera, biometric authentication, etc.) for enhanced functionality.
Offline capability for non-critical functions (e.g., viewing cached data or preparing a transfer to send when online).
Secure data handling within the native app sandbox (harder to intercept than web, assuming proper app security).
SDK Integration – Cons:
Requires development effort from partner to integrate and subsequent updates to adopt new SDK versions.
Platform-specific (need to implement and maintain both Android and iOS SDKs).
Partners’ app release cycles introduce delay for end-users to get updates or fixes.
Potential integration issues (dependency conflicts or requiring certain OS versions/APIs).
WebView Integration – Pros:
Very low effort for partner to add to their app (just load a URL)
mobikul.com
.
One web codebase serves all platforms; updates are immediate and controlled by us (no partner action needed).
Consistent experience across platforms – the web UI will look the same on Android and iOS.
Decouples feature updates from the host app’s release cycle.
WebView Integration – Cons:
User experience not as smooth as native (web content loading and differing UI controls).
Requires internet connection at all times (no offline support).
Limited access to native features (and more complex to integrate device capabilities like camera, notifications).
Web content embedded in app introduces additional security considerations (must harden WebView, ensure content is trusted and transmitted securely).
Comparison: White-Label App vs. In-App Integration
Beyond the SDK vs WebView decision, it’s important to compare the overall approaches of delivering a separate white-label app versus embedding the module in a partner’s existing app. The following table outlines key differences:
Aspect	White-Label App	Embedded in Partner App (SDK/WebView)
Branding & UI Control	Full control over branding and entire user experience. The app’s UI is tailored completely to the partner’s brand (unique logo, theme, style).	Moderate control. Partners can theme the SDK slightly (or we pre-brand the WebView), but the remittance module’s UI is standardized within their app. It will resemble our design, with only minor customization to match the host app.
Development Effort	Most work is on our side: we set up and maintain the app. Partner’s effort is only to provide branding assets. However, maintaining many separate apps is complex for us (each app listing, updates, support).	Partner’s development team must integrate the module. SDK integration requires coding; WebView is simpler but still needs some integration. Our team provides the module and support, but partner expends effort to include it in their app.
Time to Market for Partner	Slower initial setup – must create and publish a new app (app store review for each new app can take time). Could be a few weeks to launch a new partner app once development is done.	Faster integration – the partner can roll out remittance in their next app update. WebView integration could be done in days; SDK integration might take a few weeks of development/testing on the partner’s side.
User Acquisition	Requires users to download a separate app for the service. This can be a barrier unless the partner actively promotes the new app. On the flip side, the partner gets a dedicated app in app stores under their brand.	Leverages the partner’s existing user base and app installs – no extra app download needed, which lowers friction. Users discover the new feature inside an app they already have, likely increasing adoption of the service.
Updates & Maintenance	Our team must update and publish each app for every change (even small fixes)
stackoverflow.com
. CI/CD automation mitigates the workload, but operational overhead grows with number of white-label apps. Each app needs monitoring (crash logs, analytics) separately.	Core platform updates instantly benefit all integrations (especially for WebView). SDK updates require partners to adopt new versions, but minor backend changes can be transparent. Maintenance is more centralized on our side. Monitoring can be unified (the SDK or web can report events to our systems), simplifying support.
Compliance & App Review	Each app must individually pass App Store/Play Store review and comply with guidelines. We must ensure that having many similar apps doesn’t violate store policies (need to emphasize unique branding and partnership in descriptions). Also, if partners are in different countries, we might need to modify each app for local compliance (e.g., display specific terms or licenses).	The feature is part of the partner’s app, which presumably already meets store guidelines. We just need to ensure our module doesn’t introduce any compliance issues in their app. From a regulatory perspective, the remittance service itself must be licensed/approved, but whether it’s a separate app or in-app, the requirements are similar. The difference is operational: e.g., changes in compliance process roll out once rather than updating many apps.
Partner Autonomy	The partner gets a standalone product they can market independently. However, they rely on us to maintain it (they can’t modify the app beyond what we allow in config).	The partner’s app remains the primary interface; they have more control over the user journey (they decide how to introduce the feature, where it sits in the navigation, etc.). The trade-off is they cannot alter the core remittance functionality, but they integrate it on their terms.
Scaling to Many Partners	Modern CI/CD can handle dozens of apps, but each additional app adds overhead. Very large scales (100+ apps) could strain the process (build times, store management) and could clutter app stores with duplicates.	Highly scalable – whether 10 partners or 100, each integration is a relatively lightweight addition (especially WebView). The bottleneck becomes backend scalability and support, not the integration method. It avoids the app store duplication issue since the feature lives inside existing apps.
This comparison shows that white-label apps offer maximum branding control but at the cost of more maintenance overhead, whereas embedded integrations are efficient and user-friendly but require more partner-side development effort and some compromise on branding consistency.
Security and Compliance Considerations
Security is paramount for a financial application, and compliance with remittance regulations is non-negotiable. We will implement rigorous security measures aligned with OWASP Mobile Security guidelines and ensure the system meets all regulatory requirements in the domains it operates.
Mobile Application Security (OWASP Best Practices)
Both the white-label apps and the integrated SDK/WebView modules will follow industry best practices for mobile security:
Secure Data Storage: No sensitive personal data or credentials will be stored in plaintext on the device. Use the platform keystore/Keychain for storing secrets like authentication tokens. Sensitive data at rest (if any) will be encrypted using proven algorithms (AES-256)
cheatsheetseries.owasp.org
. For example, if the app caches transaction history, it will do so in an encrypted database. We will also prevent data leakage via device features: disable screenshots on sensitive screens (to avoid data showing up in app switcher on Android, or iOS background snapshots)
cheatsheetseries.owasp.org
.
Secure Network Communication: All communication between app/SDK and servers will be over HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ enforced. We will always use HTTPS for network calls
cheatsheetseries.owasp.org
 – no plaintext HTTP. Certificate validation will be strict (no ignoring self-signed certs or using insecure SSL contexts). We may implement certificate pinning for the API domain to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, which adds an extra layer beyond standard TLS.
Authentication and Session Management: JWT or OAuth 2.0 tokens will be used for session management, with short lifetimes and refresh tokens as needed. Tokens will be stored securely (in Keychain/keystore as mentioned). The app/SDK will automatically log out users after periods of inactivity or if suspicious activity is detected. We’ll enforce strong password policies at registration and support biometric authentication (fingerprint/Face ID) as a convenient second factor for logins.
Input Validation and Output Encoding: Although much validation happens server-side, the app will also validate inputs (e.g., ensuring amounts are numeric and within allowed ranges, texts have no disallowed characters) to provide immediate feedback and reduce invalid requests. This guards against malformed data and some injection vectors. Any data displayed back to the user (like support messages or transaction details) will be properly encoded to prevent any possibility of reflected injection even in WebView context.
Code Obfuscation & Tamper Resistance: The release builds of the Android app/SDK will be obfuscated using ProGuard/R8 (which also removes debugging information). This makes it harder for an attacker to reverse engineer. We will strip debugging symbols from iOS release builds and enable Swift optimization flags that obscure code flow. Additionally, we consider runtime protections: e.g., the apps/SDK can detect if running on a rooted/jailbroken device and either warn the user or disable certain functionality to prevent misuse on compromised devices.
Dependency Management: Keep all third-party libraries updated to their latest secure versions
cheatsheetseries.owasp.org
. Any library that becomes unmaintained or develops a vulnerability will be replaced or patched. We will use tools (like OWASP Dependency Check or Snyk) to scan for known vulnerabilities in our app dependencies regularly.
Logging and Privacy: The apps/SDK will avoid logging sensitive information. No personal data or authentication tokens will be printed to console or persistent logs
cheatsheetseries.owasp.org
. For analytics and crash reports, we will anonymize or hash personal identifiers. We will comply with privacy by design, collecting only what is necessary (e.g., device info for fraud detection but not invasive data).
Testing & Audit: Before each release, we will conduct security testing. This includes automated scans (static code analysis, dynamic analysis with tools like MobSF) and possibly engaging third-party pen-testers to assess the mobile apps. We will use OWASP MASVS (Mobile Application Security Verification Standard) as a checklist to ensure we haven’t missed any best practice.
API & Backend Security
The mobile frontend is just one part; the backend must be equally secure:
Authentication: The backend will authenticate every API call from the app via tokens. We’ll implement proper expiration, rotation, and revocation of tokens (if a device is lost or a token suspected compromised, we can revoke server-side).
Authorization: Multi-tenant awareness – ensure that one partner’s app or user cannot access another partner’s data. Even though the apps are separate, the backend will enforce that, say, requests from App A cannot fetch resources belonging to App B. This might be done via scoped API keys or embedded partner IDs in token claims.
Rate Limiting & Throttling: To prevent abuse and certain attacks (brute-force or DDoS), the backend will throttle excessive requests. For example, limit login attempts per minute per IP/user, limit transaction submission rate to a reasonable threshold, etc. This protects against automation attacks and helps ensure stability.
Data Encryption & Protection: Data in databases (especially user PII and transaction details) will be encrypted at rest. We’ll use field-level encryption for highly sensitive fields (e.g., storing ID document numbers encrypted). Backups will also be encrypted. Furthermore, any files stored (like copies of uploaded ID documents) will be in secure storage (encrypted file system or object storage with access control).
Monitoring & Incident Response: We will have monitoring in place on the backend for unusual patterns (many failed logins, high transaction errors, etc.). This ties into fraud detection as well. We’ll set up alerts for critical security events. An incident response plan will be in place so that if a breach or issue occurs, we can quickly inform partners, patch the system, and update the apps as needed.
Compliance with Remittance Regulations
Being a remittance service, compliance is as important as technical security. Key compliance considerations include:
KYC (Know Your Customer): The system will enforce KYC completion before a user can fully utilize remittance features. During onboarding, the app/SDK will collect required identity information and documents. We will integrate with a compliance service or in-house team for verifying identity documents and performing due diligence. The process will adhere to the regulations of each region (for example, collecting Social Security Number for US senders if required, or Emirates ID for UAE, etc., based on jurisdiction). KYC data will be transmitted securely to the backend and stored with high security. The app will provide status feedback (e.g., “Your account is under verification”) and guide the user through any additional steps if necessary.
AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Controls: Our backend will have an AML compliance program coded into it. This includes:
Transaction monitoring rules: e.g., flagging if a user attempts transactions that cumulatively exceed certain thresholds within a day/week, or if patterns seem suspicious (multiple transfers just under a reporting threshold, etc.).
Sanctions and PEP screening: Every beneficiary or sender’s name may be screened against global sanctions lists and politically exposed persons lists. This can happen at account creation and at transaction time. If a match or high-risk entity is detected, the system should block the transaction and raise an alert for manual review

Reporting and audit trail: The system will log all transactions with necessary details to produce regulatory reports (e.g., Currency Transaction Reports for large amounts, Suspicious Activity Reports if needed). These logs will be available to our compliance officers through an admin interface.
Ongoing monitoring: Even after initial KYC, the system should periodically re-check users (some regulations require periodic KYC renewal or ongoing name screening as lists are updated). We will implement triggers for such events and include functionality to request updated info from users if needed.
Licensing and Regional Compliance: Remittances typically require a Money Transmitter License or equivalent in each jurisdiction. The project plan assumes that we either have these licenses or we are partnering with someone who does. Technically, we might need to adapt the app per region – e.g., limit certain corridors if not allowed, or show specific disclaimers as required by local law. We will work with compliance experts to incorporate these. For example, if a country requires explicit user consent for each transfer with certain wording, the app will display that. If certain corridors are blocked (due to sanctions), the app will not allow those selections.
Data Privacy Regulations: We will comply with GDPR for EU users, CCPA for California, and similar laws. That means providing a privacy policy in-app, offering ways for users to request data deletion, and ensuring data is stored in approved regions. The apps will include consent prompts where required (for example, consent to use personal data for KYC, consent for storing biometric if any, etc.).
Secure Customer Support: Since support is integrated, we must ensure any in-app chat or support channel is secure and encrypted. If users share personal or financial info in support messages, that channel must be protected. Also, support personnel should have proper authentication to access the support dashboard, and their actions might be audited.
Training and Awareness: Internally, our team (and possibly partner staff, if they handle any part of the remittance service) will be trained on compliance procedures. This isn’t directly in the app, but it affects how we design features (e.g., allowing manual override of a flagged transaction by a compliance officer through an admin tool, etc.). As suggested in compliance guides, having a strong AML program with controls and training is essential

.
By following OWASP guidelines for security and implementing the above compliance measures (KYC, AML, data protection), we aim to create a system that is safe for users and meets all legal obligations. Regular audits (both technical security audits and compliance audits) will be scheduled to maintain these standards as we grow.
Architecture Diagrams and Module Boundaries
Overall System Architecture: The system can be viewed as multiple front-end clients converging on a common backend platform. Key elements include:
Mobile Front-Ends:
White-Label Apps: Each partner’s branded app (iOS and Android) communicates with the backend via REST/JSON or GraphQL APIs over HTTPS. These apps are independent of each other, but all connect to the same endpoints. They embed the remittance logic natively.
Partner App with SDK: The SDK runs within the partner’s mobile app process. When it needs to perform an action (like submit a transfer), it calls the backend APIs directly (using an API key or token provided during initialization). From the backend’s perspective, there’s no difference between a request from an SDK inside a partner app and one from a standalone app – except maybe an identifier indicating source.
Partner App with WebView: Here, the partner app opens an embedded browser pointed at our web module. The web module (a mini web app for remittance) communicates with the backend via the same APIs. The WebView essentially acts as a hosted container for a web client. The web app might use session tokens or an OAuth login to authorize the user, or the partner app passes a token to the web app for auth.
Backend Platform:
Application Server: Hosts all business logic as APIs. For example, endpoints like /login, /sendMoney, /getTransactions etc. This layer handles authentication, enforces limits, talks to databases, and integrates with third-party services (like a payment gateway or banking API to actually move money).
Database: Stores user accounts, KYC info, beneficiary details, transaction records, etc. It may also store partner-specific configurations (like exchange rate margins or fees per partner, if those vary).
Compliance Services: Could be integrated within the application server or as separate microservices. These services handle tasks like sanctions screening (possibly calling an external API or database), transaction monitoring (evaluating rules), and generating compliance reports.
Integration with Financial Networks: The backend will integrate with whatever systems actually execute the remittance (for example, SWIFT or a local banking switch, or a payout partner’s API). These are beyond the scope of this mobile-focused plan, but it is a critical part of the overall system.
Admin & Support Tools: A back-office web interface for our internal team (and maybe partners) to manage the system (view users, transactions, handle support tickets, etc.). This would interface with the backend as well, using privileged APIs.
Module Boundaries:
On the mobile side, we delineate modules as follows:
Core vs. Config (White-Label): The core code module vs. branding config modules, as described, ensuring that adding a new partner mostly means adding new config, not changing code.
SDK as Module: The SDK (for iOS/Android) is a separate deliverable, essentially a subset of the app’s code packaged for third-party use. It exposes a controlled interface and hides implementation details from the host app.
WebView Module: The web app for remittance is a self-contained module (likely hosted on a subdomain like remit.partner.com). It is developed by us, but it’s effectively part of the front-end layer. It will have its own codebase (web code) and should be designed for embedding (e.g., possibly suppressing some navigation like no need for independent header if the host app provides one).
On the backend side, boundaries can be drawn as:
Authentication Service, User Service, Transaction Service, etc., or all-in-one – depending on our architecture style (microservices vs monolith). Regardless, these services are multi-tenant by design, differentiating partners by identifiers but handling logic commonly.
External Integrations: Abstracted behind interfaces or microservices – e.g., a service for KYC provider integration, one for payment disbursal – so that front-end modules don’t talk directly to external parties.
The backend should also enforce any partner-specific configurations globally. For instance, if Partner A has a special fee structure or limit, the backend might be configured with that and apply it when processing requests from Partner A’s app.
While a visual diagram would illustrate these relationships (multiple apps and SDKs pointing to one cloud backend, etc.), in text form: imagine a central cloud representing the Remittance Platform Backend, and on the user side, multiple boxes: App 1 (White-label), App 2 (White-label), Partner App A + SDK, Partner App B + WebView, all connecting to that central backend. The flow of data is always secure and authenticated. Module boundaries ensure that each component (mobile app, SDK, web module, backend services) can be developed, tested, and maintained somewhat independently, with well-defined interfaces between them.
Toolchain and CI/CD Pipeline Recommendations
To manage the development and deployment of this system, we recommend the following tools and practices:
Version Control & Collaboration: Use Git for source control. Adopt a branching strategy such as GitFlow or trunk-based development as appropriate. For example, have a main or release branch for stable code and feature branches for new development. Use pull requests with code reviews to ensure quality and security (particularly for critical sections like auth or encryption code).
Continuous Integration (CI): Set up CI pipelines to run on every commit/merge. This includes:
Building the Android and iOS projects (for at least one flavor) to catch build breaks early.
Running automated tests (unit tests, and if possible, headless UI tests).
Running linting and static analysis (e.g., Android Lint, SwiftLint, plus security linters if available).
Possibly integrate danger or similar tools to enforce certain checks on PRs (like ensuring no large secrets committed, etc.).
Continuous Delivery (CD): Use the CI infrastructure to also handle distribution:
Configure separate workflows for distribution builds (maybe triggered manually or on tagging a release). These would perform the white-label multi-app build as described, using Fastlane or native scripts.
Utilize Bitrise/Codemagic for their specialized steps: e.g., Bitrise has steps for deploying to TestFlight or uploading dSYMs for crash symbolication. Codemagic can similarly automate Play Store uploads.
Implement a system to manage configurations for each partner in CI. For instance, a simple approach: a YAML file listing all partner app configs, which a CI script can iterate over to trigger each build. Codemagic’s REST API could trigger a pipeline for each config with parameters
github.com
. In Bitrise, we might set up a “primary” workflow that triggers sub-workflows for each partner

.
Automated Testing Pipeline: Set up device farm testing for at least critical flows. For example, use Firebase Test Lab or BrowserStack App Automate to run a basic smoke test on a range of devices for each white-label app build. This helps ensure that resource switching (like different logos or longer app names) doesn’t crash or misalign UI on various screen sizes.
Performance Monitoring: As part of QA, use tools like Android Profiler and Xcode Instruments to ensure the app (and SDK) perform well (smooth UI, no memory leaks). Especially for the SDK, we want to guarantee it won’t bloat the partner app or cause slowdowns.
DevOps for Backend: Although the focus is mobile, mention that the backend will also follow CI/CD (with automated tests, and infrastructure-as-code for deploying securely to production). Ensuring backend reliability is crucial since all clients depend on it.
Issue Tracking & Support: Use an issue tracker (JIRA, Trello, etc.) to manage development tasks and bugs. For partner integrations, possibly have a dedicated support channel or ticket system so partner developers can reach us if they encounter issues with the SDK or API.
Pros/Cons of Tools Mentioned: We chose Bitrise/Codemagic for ease of mobile CI – they provide easy environment setup for Mac builds and have good integration with Fastlane. Fastlane itself greatly eases multi-app management (especially things like code signing for many bundle IDs, as it can reuse certificates and just make new profiles
docs.fastlane.tools
). These tools will reduce manual steps and errors in building dozens of variants.
Documentation & Examples: Maintain a developer portal for the SDK (with integration guide, Javadoc/Docstrings, etc.) and perhaps publish sample apps showing integration. Also provide a style guide for partners on how the web integration will appear, so they can adjust if needed.
CI for SDK: We will also treat the SDK as its own product – meaning it should have CI verifying that it builds as a standalone library, and maybe a sample app test. When we update the SDK, we should run a pipeline that builds a dummy host app with the new SDK to ensure integration is smooth.
In summary, automation is key. By using modern CI/CD with the likes of Fastlane, Bitrise, and Codemagic, we ensure that whether it’s generating 10 branded apps or delivering an SDK update to partners, the process is repeatable and reliable. This toolchain will support rapid iteration (important for patching security issues or adding features across all partners) and help maintain a high quality bar through continuous testing and monitoring.
Timelines and Implementation Plan
We outline a high-level timeline for implementing these features, broken into phases. The timeline is approximate and assumes a dedicated development team. Some phases can proceed in parallel:
Planning & Design (2-3 weeks): Gather detailed requirements from internal stakeholders and prospective partners. Define the branding customization parameters and gather sample assets from at least one partner for pilot. Decide on SDK vs WebView offering specifics (possibly plan to offer both). Perform a risk assessment (security, regulatory) upfront to ensure design addresses all concerns. Dependencies: Input from compliance/legal teams for regulatory requirements; partner feedback for branding needs.
Core Architecture Update (4 weeks): Refactor the existing mobile app codebases to support white-label configurations. Introduce build variants/flavors, externalize branding resources (e.g., move hardcoded strings or images to config files). Ensure the app can be built with at least two different configurations (e.g., an “internal test brand” and a default brand) as proof of concept. Likewise, modularize any code that will go into the SDK (e.g., isolate networking code, make sure UI flows can be launched independently). Dependencies: Completion of design specs; existing code familiarity.
CI/CD Pipeline Setup (3 weeks): Implement the automated build system. Set up the Bitrise/Codemagic workflows: one for running tests on push, another for building release variants. Configure Fastlane lanes for tasks like incrementing versions and deploying. Test the pipeline with dummy data (perhaps create a couple of test brands to build). Dependencies: Core architecture update largely done (so that builds won’t fail due to missing config).
SDK Development (6-8 weeks, overlapping with pipeline setup): Develop the iOS and Android SDKs. This includes extracting the common functionality from the app into library form, writing wrapper code to present UI modally in host apps, and creating clear API methods for partners. Write thorough documentation and a sample integration app for each platform. Begin internal testing of the SDK within a simple container app. Dependencies: Core update phase should be at least partially completed (so the code being extracted is stable).
WebView Module Development (4-6 weeks, overlapping): If pursuing the WebView option, implement the web-based UI. This could be done by a web developer in parallel. Reuse the design from the mobile app to ensure consistency. Set up the hosting environment and ensure authentication flow (how the web app knows the user identity from the partner app) is secure and works (could use a token handoff or require the user to log in to remittance again in the WebView). Dependencies: Backend APIs must be accessible and CORS configured if needed for web.
Backend Enhancements (ongoing, ~6 weeks): While not the main focus, the backend will likely need enhancements: multi-tenant support (if not already), new endpoints for any additional data required by partners (e.g., an endpoint to fetch branding or partner-specific content if needed), integration of KYC provider, etc. This also includes building out compliance automation in the backend. Dependencies: Planning phase inputs on compliance; possibly need to choose third-party services (KYC vendor, etc.) which could affect integration timeline.
Security Review & Testing (2 weeks, can overlap final dev): Conduct a thorough security review of the system. This includes reviewing code (especially authentication flows, token storage, etc.), running penetration testing tools on the app (and web module), and possibly an external audit. Address any critical issues found. Also verify compliance checklists (did we include all necessary user consent dialogs? Are we storing logs properly? etc.). Dependencies: Bulk of development completed (at least in a testable state).
Pilot Launch (2-4 weeks): Choose one or two partners for a pilot. For example, Partner X will get a white-label app first. Partner Y will integrate the SDK in their app. Work closely with them: for the white-label app, publish it in a beta (TestFlight/Play Internal Testing) for their review. For the SDK, support their developers as they incorporate it (possibly our engineers on standby to help). During this pilot, closely monitor everything – app stability, user feedback, and backend performance. This phase helps refine any last details (maybe the theming needed an adjustment, or the SDK needed an additional callback – these can be addressed quickly). Dependencies: At least one partner willing and ready to participate; the previous phases functional.
Full Rollout (ongoing): After successful pilots, we proceed to onboard more partners. This involves operationalizing the white-label app generation (perhaps creating a simple internal form or script to onboard a new partner’s details and trigger the pipeline). Similarly, for SDK/WebView, make the integration kit available publicly (or privately to partners) along with documentation. The timeline for each additional partner becomes shorter – a new white-label app might take 1-2 weeks from receiving assets to app store submission (most of it waiting for review), and an SDK integration depends on the partner’s dev cycle. We will plan capacity such that we can handle multiple partner onboardings in parallel (e.g., dedicate a small team for partner support).
Throughout these phases, dependencies like regulatory approvals or app store account setups for each partner must be managed. For example, if a partner wants the app under their own account, we need them to create developer accounts and add us, which can take time. This should be initiated early in the process for each partner. We estimate about 3-4 months to have the first pilotable product (with one white-label app and an SDK ready), given parallel work. A more feature-complete rollout (with web option and multiple partners) could extend to 6+ months. Proper scheduling and resource allocation (mobile devs, backend devs, QA, DevOps, etc.) will ensure these tracks progress smoothly. In terms of dependencies among tasks: the mobile core refactoring is foundational – it unlocks the ability to build variants and the SDK extraction. The CI setup can start in parallel once the idea of flavors is proven. SDK and Web can be built somewhat in parallel by different teams (one native team, one web team), both relying on stable backend APIs. Compliance and security tasks run throughout, but a final sign-off is needed before any production launch. We will also buffer time for App Store review processes in the timeline. Each white-label app might face initial scrutiny (especially if many similar apps appear, we should be ready to explain they are for different financial institutions). Apple’s review could take a week or more for first submission, so factor that in before partner launch dates. Finally, set a tentative schedule for post-launch evaluations – e.g., 1 month after go-live with first partner, do a retrospective to capture lessons and adjust processes, making subsequent rollouts smoother.
By following this comprehensive plan, we can deliver a system that efficiently serves multiple partners through both branded apps and embedded integrations. The approach balances rapid go-to-market for partners with maintainability for our team, all while upholding the necessary security and compliance standards for a financial application. The phased execution with pilots ensures we can validate and refine the solution in real-world conditions, leading to a successful full deployment.
